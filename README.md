# Agents of Love ðŸ’–

An AI-powered dating simulation platform that creates virtual date scenarios and analyzes interpersonal dynamics using blockchain technology and AI agents.

## Description

Imagine a world where you can go on a virtual "date" with Nikola Tesla, Bruce Lee, ELIZA, or any AI-generated character of your choiceâ€”without worrying about what to say or boring conversations.

We have created an virtual dating experience where users can 'clone' themselves into avatars and interact with AI-generated characters in a dynamic, fully autonomous environment. Each AI character and user avatar has its own CDP wallet, enabling transactions like paying for dates, buying virtual gifts, and even minting memories as NFTs.

### How It Works:
1. Create Your AI Avatar â€“ Users generate a digital twin with their personality, interests, and preferences by chatting with the Date Manager Agent in a Discord channel.
2. Match & Date AI Characters â€“ Let the Date Manager pair you or choose a pre-created AI characters like Donald Trump, ELIZA, Tesla, or Bruce Lee.
3. Autonomous Date Simulation â€“ The Date Organizer coordinates dates in the backend. Users can simply let the AI run the date.
4. Fully Autonomous Agentsâ€“ Avatars and AI characters can decide when to pay for dates, buy gifts, and interact dynamically based on how the date unfolds.
5. Multi-agent Assistance â€“ Background AI agents, such as a Date Organizer and Conversation Selector work behind the scene with the Data Manager to ensure a seamless and engaging experience.
6. Date Highlights â€“ Users can observe date highlights, chat with the Date Manager for insights, or view their gifts and selfies which take place in a Discord channel with a privacy toggle. 
7. Mint Date Memories as NFTs â€“ Avatars can take selfies, exchange gifts, buy souvenirs, and capture memories as mintable NFTs that are sent to their wallets after the date.


### Core Dating Features
- Create personalized AI dating profiles with:
  - Interests and hobbies
  - Personality traits
  - Conversation styles
  - Areas of expertise
  - Personal preferences and dislikes
  - Unique experiences
- Run natural date simulations between AI agents and Avatars with distinct personalities
- Get detailed analysis of date chemistry and interaction dynamics
- Save conversations and summaries as markdown files
- AI-generated date environment and scene settings
- Persistant memory for AI assistant


## How It's Made
- Custom Starknet Tools for Autogen - Implemented custom tools for Starknet to be used in Autogen using starknet-py to allow agents to autonomously deploy accounts, transfer tokens, mint NFTs, and check balances depending on their permissions.
- Coinbase Agent Kit â€“ Each user avatar and AI character is equipped with a CDP wallet for payment
- Multi-Agent System: The system runs on Autogen, coordinating multiple AI agents:
  - Three AI Assistants (Date Manager, Date Organizer, Conversation Selector) handle date logistics. We used prompts to define their roles.
  - Fully Autonomous Agents (user avatars & AI characters) also have unique character files defining their communication style and personality. We used prompts for dating guideline.
- Discord as the Frontend and primary UI
- Full date simulation run run on a server-side backend using Autogen
- NFT smart contracts deployed by the agent:
  - on Base Sepolia (contract address: 0xb598fFa84C2608cC93b203772A6A2683a84aC959). NFT date memories minted by the agent, viewable on OpenSea (https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/date-memories).
  - on Starknet Mainnet (contract address: 0x07881ce471fad37b0344100cf86efdccce1c93dafc15c52c1c3114da5193419e). NFT date memories minted by the agent, viewable on Element (https://element.market/assets/starknet/0x07881ce471fad37b0344100cf86efdccce1c93dafc15c52c1c3114da5193419e).
