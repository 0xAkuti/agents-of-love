# Agents of Love ðŸ’–

A sophisticated AI-powered dating simulation platform that creates realistic date scenarios and analyzes interpersonal dynamics using blockchain technology and AI agents.

## Description

Imagine a world where you can go on a virtual "date" with Nikola Tesla, Bruce Lee,  ELIZA, or any AI-generated character of your choiceâ€”without worrying about what to say or boring conversations.

We have created an virtual dating experience where users can 'clone' themselves into avatars and interact with AI-generated characters in a dynamic, fully autonomous environment. Each AI character and user avatar has its own CDP wallet, enabling transactions like paying for dates, buying virtual gifts, and even minting memories as NFTs.

### How It Works:
1. Create Your AI Avatar â€“ Users generate a digital twin with their personality, interests, and preferences by chatting with the Date Manager Agent in a Discord channel.
2. Match & Date AI Characters â€“ Let the Date Manager pair you or choose a pre-created AI characters like Donald Trump, ELIZA, Tesla, or Bruce Lee.
3. Autonomous Date Simulation â€“ The Date Organizer coordinates dates in the backend. Users can simply let the AI run the date.
4. Fully Autonomous Agentsâ€“ Avatars and AI characters can decide when to pay for dates, buy gifts, and interact dynamically based on how the date unfolds.
5. Multi-agent Assistance â€“ Background AI agents, such as a Date Organizer and Conversation Selector work behind the scene with the Data Manager to ensure a seamless and engaging experience.
6. Date Highlights â€“ Users can observe date highlights, chat with the Date Manager for insights, or view their gifts and selfies which take place in a Discord channel with a privacy toggle. 
7. Mint Date Memories as NFTs â€“ Avatars can take selfies, exchange gifts, buy souvenirs, and capture memories as mintable NFTs that are sent to their wallets after the date.
